- ## Prerequisites
- Unity 2020.3.32f1 or higher
- Visual studio or any IDE with .NET
- Windows operating system

- ## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Shino974/Swimming-Plouf.git
  - Add the project with Unity 
  - Start the project (for debug mode) or go to file -> Build and run (for an .exe)

- ## Usage
You can move around with the arrow keys.
The game is pretty simple, you just have to collect as many stars as possible while avoiding the sharks.
